# Introduction #

I have realized that some parts of code need to be refactored. Especially I want to have some common code for both client and server, for example parsing code.



# Stuff to think about #

  * **class diagrams** yeah, I still do not feel OK about them - let's draw 'dem once and for all
  * **project organization** - it's getting too messy to have all the project sources in the one directory. I should reorganize parts of project into packages. Some diagrams should be drawn as well.
  * **threads** Recently I started to doubt if I really need them - they are used for AIs now
