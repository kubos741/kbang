# KBang Roadmap #

## KBang 0.2 ##
  * **Card sets.** We are still facing the licence issues, because we are using copyrighted material (card pictures) in an open-source code without permission of the copyright holder. The idea is to distribute KBang without those pictures and distribute them in other way. [CardSet\_Architecture](CardSet_Architecture.md) will allow this.
  * **Protocol changes.** We need to change the protocol to make it suitable for expansions.
  * **Code refactoring.** A lot of code in client is not really nice, because I had strict deadlines when I wrote it. Now it should be repaired.
  * **Spectator mode.**

## KBang 0.3 ##
  * **Dodge City.**
